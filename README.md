# My Portfolio

## Introduction
I am a **Data/ML Professional** with a unique background blending **Control Systems Engineering** with modern **AI & Cloud Architecture**. I specialize in bridging the gap between Data Science and Engineering—building robust pipelines, training predictive models, and deploying scalable AI solutions.

With certifications in **AWS AI**, **Oracle Cloud**, and **Data Engineering**, I offer end-to-end expertise: from provisioning infrastructure with Terraform to fine-tuning LLMs for production.
